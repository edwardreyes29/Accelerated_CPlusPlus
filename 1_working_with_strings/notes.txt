std::endl -> moves cursor to a new line.

std:string name; -> is a definition.

null or empty, string with no value

<< ouput operator
>> input operator -> reads a string from the standard input and stores it a variable.

Buffer:
input-output library saves  its output in an internal data structure called a buffer, 
which it uses to optimize output operations.

To avoid overhead, of writing a response to each output request, the library uses the buffer to accumulate the 
characters to be written, and flushes the buffer, bu writing its contents to the output device, only when necessary.

Three events that cause the system to flush the buffer:
    1. When buffer is full, the library will flush automatically.
    2. If library is asked to read from the standard input stream, the library immediately
        flushes the output buffer without waiting for the buffer to become full.
    3. When we explicitly say to do so.

    When program writes prompt to cout, the output goes into the buffer associated with the standard output stream.
    When attempting to read from cin, it flushes the output buffer.

    std::endl ends the line of the output, and then flushes the buffer, which forces the system to write to the output
    stream immediately.
